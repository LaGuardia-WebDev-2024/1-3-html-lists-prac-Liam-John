        Nitroglycerin recipe
      </h2> 
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> Fill a 75-milliliter beaker, to the 13-ml. level, with fuming red nitric acid, of 98 percent concentration.</li>
        <li>Place beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room temperature.
           After it is cooled, add to it three times the amount of fuming sulfuric acid (99 percent HÂ»SO,). In other words, add to the now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 milliliters of fuming sulfuric acid. When mixing any acids, always do it slowly and carefully to avoid splattering.
          When the two are mixed, lower their temperature, by adding more ice to the bath, to about 10 or 15 degrees Centigrade. This can be measured by using a mercury-operated Centigrade thermometer.
